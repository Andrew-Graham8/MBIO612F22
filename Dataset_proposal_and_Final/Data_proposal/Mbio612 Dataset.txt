Mbio612 Dataset
This dataset represents data collected at Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve during 2020 and 2021. It has the flight responses of eight different species across four sites at Hanauma Bay. These species include Acanthurus blochii, Acanthurus triostegus, Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Naso lituratus, Scarus rubroviolacues, Scarus Psittacus, and Thalassoma duperrey. There are two time points: the first when Hanauma bay was closed to the public from March 2020 – December 2020, and then second right after the Bay reopened to the public from January 2021 – June 2021. Data collected includes the family, genus, and species of fish, size of target species from nose tip to tail tip, school size, starting distance, flight distance, and minimum approach distance. All length and size data were recorded in millimeters. Data was collected using stereo-video cameras at the Bay and analyzed using EventMeasure Software. As listed above, the data for each target fish includes the starting distance from the fish, size of the fish, flight distance of when the fish responded to human approach, and minimum approach distance which is the closest you can get to the target fish at any point before or after the flight response. A flight response was measured by a change in speed or direction of the fish away from the observer. Flight response categories include flee, evade, shelter, or none. Our sample size goal was 20 responses per species in each of the four sectors of the bay (Backdoor, Keyhole, Channel, and Witches Brew) for each treatment period (Hanauma bay closed to public and reopened to public) for a total sample n=160 per species. Due to time constraints and access to the bay this was not possible for every species however there are over 1000 points of data that were collected. Data files were separated by species and include the first two letters of the genus and species (ex: Acanthurus blochii is saved as ACBL).
